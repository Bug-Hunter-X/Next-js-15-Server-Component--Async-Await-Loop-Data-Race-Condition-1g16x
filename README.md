# Next.js 15 Server Component Async/Await Loop Data Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in Next.js 15 server components when using `async/await` within loops for data fetching.  The issue arises from improperly handling the `await` keyword, leading to data race conditions and potentially inconsistent data being used during iteration.

## Problem Description

The problem occurs when an asynchronous operation, such as fetching data from an API or database, is performed within a loop.  If the `await` keyword is not correctly used, the loop might continue before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to undefined or outdated data being used in subsequent iterations.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that each iteration of the loop waits for the asynchronous operation to complete before moving to the next iteration.  This typically involves using `await` within the loop body.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Observe the potential for inconsistent data rendering in the browser.
